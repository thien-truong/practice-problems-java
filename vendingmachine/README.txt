Problem: Vending Machine
Language: Java
Author: Thien Truong

1. Create a software design for a basic vending machine. What are the functional components
of the user interface? What are the possible states of the vending machine, and what are
the transitions between those states? What are the functions of the vending machine? Create
and submit written descriptions, flow charts, state diagrams, etc., as necessary to document
your design. We're interested only in the functional design, not the visual/physical design.

2. Write Java code implementing the virtual vending machine you designed. Demonstrate your
understanding of object-oriented design and good coding practices.

3. Write a command-line test program that allows a user to test your vending machine.
The user should be able to see a list of snacks/prices, select a snack, put money into the
machine, receive money back, etc.
